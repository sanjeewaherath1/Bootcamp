These systems analyze user behavior, preferences, and interactions with items (products, movies, music, articles, etc.) to predict and offer items that users are likely to be interested in. Recommendation engines play a crucial role in enhancing user experience, driving engagement, and increasing conversion rates in various applications, including e-commerce, entertainment, content platforms, and more.\n","\n","There are generally two approaches taken in collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation engines:\n","\n","**1. Collaborative Filtering:**\n","Collaborative Filtering is a popular approach to building recommendation systems that leverages the collective behavior of users to make personalized recommendations. It is based on the idea that users who have agreed in the past will likely agree in the future. There are two main types of collaborative filtering:\n","\n","- **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** This method finds users similar to the target user based on their past interactions (e.g., ratings or purchases). It then recommends items that similar users have liked but the target user has not interacted with yet.\n","\n","- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** In this approach, the system identifies similar items based on user interactions. It recommends items that are similar to the ones the target user has already liked or interacted with.\n","\n","Collaborative filtering does not require any explicit information about items but relies on the similarity between users or items. It is effective in capturing complex patterns and can provide serendipitous recommendations. However, it suffers from the cold-start problem (i.e., difficulty in recommending to new users or items with no interactions) and scalability challenges in large datasets.\n","\n","**2. Content-Based Recommendation:**\n","Content-based recommendation is an alternative approach to building recommendation systems that focuses on the attributes or features of items and users. It leverages the characteristics of items to make recommendations. The key steps involved in content-based recommendation are:\n","\n","- **Feature Extraction:** For each item, relevant features are extracted. For movies, these features could be genre, director, actors, and plot summary.\n","\n","- **User Profile:** A user profile is created based on the items they have interacted with in the past. The user profile contains the weighted importance of features based on their interactions.\n","\n","- **Similarity Calculation:** The similarity between items or between items and the user profile is calculated using similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.\n","\n","- **Recommendation:** Items that are most similar to the user profile are recommended to the user.\n","\n","Content-based recommendation systems are less affected by the cold-start problem as they can still recommend items based on their features. They are also more interpretable as they rely on item attributes. However, they may miss out on providing serendipitous recommendations and can be limited by the quality of feature extraction and user profiles.\n","\n","**Choosing Between Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based:**\n","Both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the recommendation system, the type of data available, and the user base. Hybrid approaches that combine collaborative filtering and content-based techniques are also common, aiming to leverage the strengths of both methods and mitigate their weaknesses."],"metadata":{"id":"fyXucUekO19i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this mini-project, you'll be building both content based and collaborative filtering engines for the [MovieLens 25M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/).

The underlying idea is to match the characteristics of items with the preferences of users to suggest items that align with their interests. Content-based filtering is particularly useful when explicit user-item interactions (e.g., ratings or purchases) are sparse or unavailable.\n","\n","**Key Steps in Content-Based Filtering:**\n","\n","1. **Feature Extraction:**\n","   - For each item, relevant features are extracted. These features are typically descriptive attributes that can be represented numerically, such as genre, director, actors, author, publication date, and keywords.\n","   - In the case of text-based items, natural language processing techniques may be used to extract features like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores.\n","\n","2. **User Profile Creation:**\n","   - A user profile is created based on the items they have interacted with in the past. The user profile contains the weighted importance of features based on their interactions.\n","   - For example, if a user has watched several action movies, the action genre feature would receive a higher weight in their profile.\n","\n","3. **Similarity Calculation:**\n","   - The similarity between items or between items and the user profile is calculated using similarity metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or Pearson correlation.\n","   - Cosine similarity is commonly used as it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which represents their similarity.\n","\n","4. **Recommendation:**\n","   - Items that are most similar to the user profile are recommended to the user. These are items whose features have the highest similarity scores with the user profile.\n","   - The recommended items are presented as a list sorted by their similarity scores.\n","\n","**Advantages of Content-Based Filtering:**\n","1. **No Cold-Start Problem:** Content-based filtering can make recommendations even for new users with no historical interactions because it relies on item features rather than user history.\n","\n","2. **User Independence:** The recommendations are based solely on the features of items and do not require knowledge of other users' preferences or behavior.\n","\n","3. **Transparency:** Content-based recommendations are interpretable, as they depend on the features of items, making it easier for users to understand why specific items are recommended.\n","\n","4. **Serendipity:** Content-based filtering can recommend items with characteristics not seen before by the user, leading to serendipitous discoveries.\n","\n","5. **Diversity in Recommendations:** The method can offer diverse recommendations since it suggests items with different feature combinations.\n","\n","**Limitations of Content-Based Filtering:**\n","1. **Limited Discovery:** Content-based filtering may struggle to recommend items outside the scope of users' historical interactions or interests.\n","\n","2. **Over-Specialization:** Users may receive recommendations that are too similar to their previous choices, leading to a lack of exposure to new item categories.\n","\n","3. **Dependency on Feature Quality:** The quality and relevance of item features significantly influence the quality of recommendations.\n","\n","4. **Limited for Cold Items:** Content-based filtering can struggle to recommend new items with limited feature information."],"metadata":{"id":"_U44W0TMT3qf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here is your task:\n","\n","1. Write a function that takes in a user id and the dataframe you created before that contains 'user_id', 'title', and 'rating'. The function should return content-based recommendations for this user.
